# ForceEquals Hiring Challenge – Full Stack Internship

This repository contains my submission for the ForceEquals Full Stack Development Internship Hiring Challenge. The challenge consists of two parts:

---

## 🚀 Task 1: Backend API for Account Matching

- 🏢 Fetching a list of companies with match scores
- 🎯 Toggling companies as "Target" or "Not Target"

### 🔧 Tech Used:
- Node.js
- Express.js

### 📂 Folder Structure:
/api ├── controllers/ ├── routes/ ├── task2/ <-- Task 2 is also placed here ├── data/ ├── server.js


---

## 💻 Task 2: Frontend Dashboard

A minimal UI to interact with the above API.

- 🔐 Simple login

- ✅ Mark/unmark companies as targets

### ⚙️ Tech Used:

Let me know if you want me to tailor it a bit more (e.g. if you're using Clerk, Tailwind, etc.).
